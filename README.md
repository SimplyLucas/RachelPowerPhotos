# TheDevsWebsite
The Webs Debsite
Here is the sourcecode for the Dunedin website as developed by the TheDevTeam
This website is intended to be a somewhat true to local impression on the Dunedin town village, as seen by cynical locals lol.
This website aims to
  1. Provide humor and a spark of life to the dreary town of Dunedin.
  2. Be a project for bored school students.
  3. Be useful.
These aims are in the order they are given emphasis to. Please feel free to contribute if you want.
