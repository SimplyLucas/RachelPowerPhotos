  <h1>Dunedin, the glorious town of students</h1>
  <p>Dunedin was once a goldrush town,  however, after borrowing (perminantly)
    the gold from central otago leaving various moonscapes etc, Dunedin needed a
     new form of boom and bust. So, Dunedin is as we know it today, the
     gloryios home of the brave, traffic cone wearing students.
